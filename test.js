// 
// I need to split the strings into arrays
// 
// 1,1,0,1   0,1,0,1
// 1,1,0,1   1,0,1,0
// 1,0,1     0,1,0
// 1,0,1     1,0,0
// 0,
// Brute force way would be to use nested for loop;
// check if the students gets what he wants if he does pop him from the array
// if he doesn't remove him and push him to the back of the queue
// if that happens we don't increment i
